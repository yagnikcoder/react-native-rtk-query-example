| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`createApi`**                | The main function to define your API slice. You use this to configure base URL, endpoints, etc. |
| **`baseQuery`**                | Defines how requests are made (usually using `fetchBaseQuery` or custom fetch logic).           |
| **`fetchBaseQuery`**           | A lightweight wrapper around `fetch`. Used as the default `baseQuery` to make HTTP calls.       |
| **`endpoints`**                | Object where you define API operations (like `getUsers`, `addPost`, etc.).                      |
| **`builder.query`**            | Used to define **GET** endpoints for reading data.                                              |
| **`builder.mutation`**         | Used to define **POST/PUT/DELETE** endpoints for modifying data.                                |
| **`reducerPath`**              | A unique key to identify your API slice in the Redux store.                                     |
| **`apiSlice.reducer`**         | The reducer automatically generated by `createApi` to handle caching, etc.                      |
| **`apiSlice.middleware`**      | The middleware RTK Query uses to manage caching, invalidation, and background fetching.         |
| **`useXYZQuery`**              | Auto-generated React hook for a `query` endpoint (like `useGetUsersQuery()`).                   |
| **`useXYZMutation`**           | Auto-generated hook for a `mutation` endpoint (like `useAddUserMutation()`).                    |
| **`isLoading` / `isFetching`** | Status booleans you can use to show loaders or spinners.                                        |
| **`data`**                     | The actual result of the API call.                                                              |
| **`error`**                    | Information about the API error, if one occurred.                                               |
| **`refetch()`**                | A function returned by query hooks to manually re-fetch the data.                               |
| **`invalidateTags`**           | Used in `mutation` to mark certain data as outdated (e.g., after adding/deleting items).        |
| **`providesTags`**             | Used in `query` to help RTK Query know what data it is caching.                                 |
| **`transformResponse`**        | Lets you modify the response from the API before it goes to the UI.                             |
| **`selectFromResult`**         | Allows you to select only part of the response (for optimization).                              |
| **`skip`**                     | Allows skipping a query based on a condition (e.g., only fetch if userId exists).               |
| **`pollingInterval`**          | Automatically re-fetch the query at an interval (in ms).                                        |
| **`onQueryStarted`**           | A lifecycle hook to run code (like optimistic updates) when a request starts.                   |
| **`onCacheEntryAdded`**        | Used for managing subscriptions and live updates.                                               |


















































Dispatch - Dispatch is the method used to send actions to the store.
Action - An action is a plain object that describes what happened.
Middleware - Middleware is code that runs between dispatching an action and it reaching the reducer.
Reducer - A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.
Persist / Redux Persist - Persist means saving Redux state to local storage (or async storage in React Native) so it doesn’t reset on app reload.
Slice - In Redux Toolkit, a slice is a piece of the store with its own reducer and actions bundled together..

| ---- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | UI dispatches an action      | Button press calls `dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })` |
| 2    | Middleware runs (optional)   | Logs, async APIs, etc.                               |
| 3    | Reducer handles the action   | Increments counter                                   |
| 4    | Store updates the state      | State goes from 0 → 1                                |
| 5    | UI re-renders with new state | Shows "1" on the screen                              |
